            <p>Hi, I am Sivasankar Pradeep, an international student learning Interactive Media Design at Algonquin College.
            I was born on 27<sup>th</sup> October, 2003 in <em>Kerala</em>, which is a state in India. Moving to a different
            country taught me, and is teaching me, a lot of new things. I have worked with movie directors which gave me immeasurable
            experience.</p>
            <p>I chose this course because this course provides the knowledge that I need to excel in my field
            of interest. <abbr title="Hyper Text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> and <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheet">CSS</abbr>,
            along with other languages and elements is an integral part of web development and even if creating websites
            is not my end-goal, I am sure that this will help me in my professional career. 
            </p>
